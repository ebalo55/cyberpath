## Overview

The **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** is one of the most recognized certifications in penetration
testing. Offered by Offensive Security, this certification is obtained through rigorous hands-on training and exams
designed to test a student's ability to execute and document a penetration test.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Assess and exploit various networks and machines.
- Identify and enumerate vulnerabilities.
- Develop the technical report to communicate the findings.

## Course Details

The OSCP certification is tied to the **PEN-200** course, known as **"Penetration Testing with Kali Linux"**. This
course emphasizes a self-paced, lab-intensive training methodology, where learners get hands-on exposure to various
penetration testing scenarios.

### Topics Covered:

- Exploitation techniques for various types of vulnerabilities.
- Exploit development and post-exploitation tactics.
- Network and host-based attack vectors.
- Practical skills needed for a complete penetration testing process.

## Exam Structure

The OSCP certification is awarded upon successful completion of a 24-hour practical exam, where the candidate must
compromise multiple machines in a controlled lab environment. A comprehensive penetration testing report is required for
submission at the end of the exam.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- 24-hour exam window with a focus on active exploitation.
- Documentation of all exploits used and proof of successful compromises.

## Who Should Take OSCP?

The OSCP is ideal for:

- Aspiring penetration testers.
- Security professionals looking to strengthen their offensive security skills.
