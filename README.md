## Installation

Although CyberPath is an OpenSource project and you can install it and run it locally, we recommend using the
[official website](https://cyberpath-hq.com) for the best experience.

The website is updated automatically with every new release, and you can access the latest features and resources
without the need to install anything.
Additionally, the website contains all the precompiled metadata of the certifications easily accessible via a simple
fetch request.

If you still want to run the platform locally, you can follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebalo55/cyberpath.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd cyberpath
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies, pnpm is required:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start exploring the resources available in CyberPath. The platform is designed to be
user-friendly, allowing you to easily navigate through it.

If you've chosen to deploy it locally then you'll have to run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

And access it at: [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)
