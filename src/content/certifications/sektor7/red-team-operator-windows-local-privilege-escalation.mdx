## Overview

The **Red Team Operator: Windows Local Privilege Escalation (RTO-LPE)** certification, offered by Sektor7 Institute,
focuses on mastering the techniques for elevating privileges in Windows environments. Privilege escalation is a critical
skill for red team operators and penetration testers, as it enables attackers to move from a low-privilege user to full
system control. This certification teaches participants how to identify and exploit local privilege escalation (LPE)
vulnerabilities, bypass user access controls (UAC), and maintain persistence on Windows machines.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Identify and exploit LPE vulnerabilities on Windows systems.
- Bypass security mechanisms such as UAC.
- Achieve and maintain elevated privileges to facilitate deeper attacks.

## Course Details

The **RTO-LPE** certification is based on a hands-on course designed to teach the most effective Windows privilege
escalation techniques. Participants will learn how to perform privilege escalation through various vectors, including
exploiting misconfigurations, abusing system features, and leveraging third-party software vulnerabilities.

### Topics Covered:

- Identifying and exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows.
- Techniques to bypass User Account Control (UAC).
- Privilege escalation through DLL hijacking and abusing system services.
- Exploiting insecure file permissions and misconfigurations.
- Post-exploitation techniques to maintain elevated access.

## Exam Structure

The **RTO-LPE** exam is a practical assessment where candidates must demonstrate their ability to escalate privileges
on a Windows machine. Candidates are required to exploit vulnerabilities to gain elevated access and document their
methods.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- Exploiting Windows LPE vulnerabilities successfully.
- Bypassing UAC and other security mechanisms.
- Detailed documentation of privilege escalation techniques used.

## Who Should Take RTO-LPE?

The **RTO-LPE** certification is ideal for:

- Red team specialists aiming to deepen their expertise in privilege escalation.
- Penetration testers seeking advanced skills in Windows exploitation.
- Malware developers working on persistence and escalation techniques.
- Threat hunters looking to better understand privilege escalation attacks.
