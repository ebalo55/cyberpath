## Overview

The **Red Team Operator: Windows Evasion Techniques (RTO-WE)** certification, provided by Sektor7 Institute, is designed
to teach advanced evasion strategies on Windows systems. This certification equips red team specialists and malware
developers with the knowledge and techniques necessary to bypass modern security measures, including antivirus (AV) and
endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Bypass advanced Windows security mechanisms.
- Evade detection by AV, EDR, and other defensive systems.
- Deploy stealth malware for long-term evasion and persistence.

## Course Details

The **RTO-WE** certification is built around an in-depth, hands-on course focused on real-world evasion techniques for
Windows environments. Participants learn how to create malware that can evade detection and operate under the radar,
leveraging weaknesses in the Windows operating system and common defensive tools.

### Topics Covered:

- Advanced Windows security bypass techniques.
- EDR and AV evasion strategies.
- Malware obfuscation and encryption techniques.
- Bypassing behavioral analysis and heuristic detection systems.
- Implementation of stealth and persistence tactics.

## Exam Structure

The **RTO-WE** certification exam involves a practical assessment where candidates must demonstrate their ability to
develop and deploy malware that can evade detection in a controlled Windows environment. Candidates will be tasked with
creating malware that circumvents modern defenses, maintaining persistence, and documenting their evasion techniques.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- Development of Windows malware that successfully evades AV and EDR.
- Use of obfuscation, stealth, and encryption to evade detection.
- Detailed documentation of evasion techniques and persistence strategies.

## Who Should Take RTO-WE?

The **RTO-WE** certification is ideal for:

- Malware developers focusing on stealth and evasion techniques.
- Red team specialists conducting advanced adversary simulations.
- Penetration testers seeking to improve their evasion tactics.
- Threat hunters wanting to understand the evasion techniques used by sophisticated malware.
