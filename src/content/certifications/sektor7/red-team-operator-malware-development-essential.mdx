## Overview

The **Red Team Operator: Malware Development Essentials (RTO-MDE)**, offered by Sektor7 Institute, is a specialized
certification designed to provide a solid foundation in malware development and red team operations. It teaches
participants how to design, develop, and execute custom malware to aid in advanced adversary simulations and red team
engagements.

The certification focuses on real-world scenarios that help learners understand how modern malware is built and deployed
in a controlled environment.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Develop and deploy advanced malware techniques.
- Implement and evade antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.
- Create and manage payloads for sophisticated red team operations.
- Build custom remote access trojans (RATs) and other malicious software for red team purposes.

## Course Details

The **RTO-MDE** certification is based on Sektor7's hands-on course, which emphasizes building practical skills in
malware development, particularly in C and C++ programming languages. It is designed to immerse participants in
real-world malware creation and red team strategies to enhance their offensive security capabilities.

### Topics Covered:

- Basics of malware development using C/C++.
- Evasion of security defenses such as antivirus and EDR tools.
- Payload development and encryption techniques.
- Use of Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
- Methods for persistence, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

## Exam Structure

To earn the RTO-MDE certification, candidates must complete a practical assessment that requires developing and
deploying
custom malware in a simulated environment. The exam tests the candidate's ability to bypass modern security defenses and
execute red team operations with advanced malware.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- Development of functional malware with specific evasion techniques.
- Practical demonstration of payload execution.
- Documentation of all techniques and results.
