## Overview

The **Red Team Operator: Malware Development Intermediate (RTO-MDI)** is an advanced course and certification offered by
the Sektor7 Institute, focusing on elevating skills in malware development for red team operations. Building upon
foundational knowledge, this certification takes participants deeper into malware creation techniques used in real-world
attack simulations, emphasizing stealth, persistence, and evasion.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Develop sophisticated malware to bypass advanced detection mechanisms.
- Implement techniques for persistence, privilege escalation, and covert communication.
- Execute and manage advanced adversary tactics used in high-profile red team engagements.

## Course Details

The **RTO-MDI** certification is aligned with Sektor7's intermediate-level curriculum, which emphasizes hands-on
development of complex malware for use in red team environments. The course focuses on crafting advanced payloads,
evading cutting-edge security measures, and deploying malware within simulated attack scenarios.

### Topics Covered:

- Advanced malware development using C/C++.
- Techniques to bypass modern security solutions like EDR, AV, and sandboxing.
- Implementing stealth, encryption, and obfuscation in malware.
- Building resilient Command and Control (C2) channels.
- Persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation, and stealth exfiltration tactics.
- Payload chaining and modular malware architecture.

## Exam Structure

To earn the RTO-MDI certification, candidates must complete a rigorous practical exam where they are required to design,
build, and deploy custom malware that can evade modern defenses. The exam tests their ability to apply
intermediate-level knowledge in malware development and red team operations in a real-world scenario.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- Development of highly evasive malware that bypasses EDR and antivirus systems.
- Creation and execution of advanced red team techniques such as persistence and lateral movement.
- Comprehensive documentation of all methods and payloads used.

## Who Should Take RTO-MDI?

The RTO-MDI certification is ideal for:

- Malware developers seeking to advance their skills.
- Red team specialists involved in adversary simulations.
- Threat hunters looking to enhance their understanding of sophisticated malware.
- Security professionals engaged in offensive security, particularly those focusing on advanced malware creation.
