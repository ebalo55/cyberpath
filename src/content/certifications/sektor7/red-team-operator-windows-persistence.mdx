## Overview

The **Red Team Operator: Windows Persistence (RTO-WP)** certification, offered by Sektor7 Institute, focuses on advanced
persistence techniques in Windows environments. Persistence is a crucial component in red team operations, allowing
attackers to maintain access to compromised systems even after reboots or cleanup attempts. This certification covers
methods to achieve long-term persistence in a Windows environment while remaining undetected.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Implement advanced persistence techniques on Windows systems.
- Evade detection while maintaining long-term access.
- Deploy stealthy mechanisms to ensure consistent control over compromised environments.

## Course Details

The **RTO-WP** certification is based on an immersive hands-on course that teaches participants how to implement various
persistence methods in Windows environments. From basic startup tasks to sophisticated kernel-level persistence, this
course provides practical, real-world techniques for maintaining access in red team engagements.

### Topics Covered:

- Basic and advanced Windows persistence techniques.
- Leveraging scheduled tasks, services, and startup mechanisms for persistence.
- Kernel-level persistence strategies.
- Registry manipulation and DLL hijacking for long-term access.
- Evasion techniques to remain undetected over extended periods.
- Maintaining access through stealthy Command and Control (C2) channels.

## Exam Structure

The **RTO-WP** certification exam requires candidates to demonstrate their ability to establish and maintain persistence
on a Windows machine. Candidates will implement various persistence methods and ensure their malware or payload can
survive reboots and clean-up attempts, all while remaining undetected.

### Key Exam Requirements:

- Successful implementation of advanced Windows persistence mechanisms.
- Evasion of security defenses and forensic analysis.
- Thorough documentation of persistence techniques and evasion strategies.

## Who Should Take RTO-WP?

The **RTO-WP** certification is ideal for:

- Red team specialists who need to maintain long-term access in compromised environments.
- Malware developers working on persistence mechanisms.
- Penetration testers interested in post-exploitation persistence strategies.
- Threat hunters looking to understand and counter persistence techniques used by advanced adversaries.
