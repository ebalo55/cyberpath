## Overview

The **ISC2 Security Engineering Certificates (SEC)** are designed to equip cybersecurity professionals with the
knowledge and skills necessary to design and implement secure systems. These certificates focus on critical aspects of
security engineering, providing a pathway to enhance your expertise in protecting sensitive data and infrastructure.

The certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to:

- Design secure systems and protocols.
- Conduct risk assessments and threat modeling.
- Implement effective security measures throughout the system lifecycle.

## Course Details

The SEC bundle includes three key certificates:

1. **System Security Engineering Foundations**: This foundational certificate covers essential concepts such as security
   requirements, risk assessments, and threat modeling, providing a solid base for securing systems against potential
   threats.

2. **System Security Engineering Planning and Design**: Focused on the principles of planning and designing secure
   systems, this certificate delves into system engineering concepts and best practices for robust security
   architecture.

3. **System Security Engineering Operations**: This certificate emphasizes best practices for secure operations,
   including incident response strategies and risk mitigation techniques.

### Topics Covered:

- Principles of secure system design.
- Risk management strategies.
- Incident response planning and execution.
