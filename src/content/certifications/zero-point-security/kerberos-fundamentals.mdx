## Overview

The **Certified Kerberos Fundamentals (KF)** certification is designed for cybersecurity professionals who want to gain
a comprehensive understanding of Kerberos authentication within Windows environments. This course covers the essential
concepts, protocols, and security implications of Kerberos, enabling candidates to analyze and secure Kerberos
implementations effectively.

The certification validates an individual’s ability to:

- Understand the end-to-end authentication flow in a Windows domain.
- Capture, decrypt, and analyze Kerberos traffic using Wireshark.
- Identify and mitigate common attacks such as ASREPRoasting and Kerberoasting.
